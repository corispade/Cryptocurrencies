# Cryptocurrencies

# Overview

Using unsupervised machine learning to create an analysis on a dataset of cryptocurrencies and discover trends for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. We are creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment. 

## Process:

View code [here](https://github.com/corispade/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb) for reference of the below deliverables.

### Deliverable 1: Using Pandas to preprocess and clean the data set
* Keep all cryptocurrencies that are currently being traded
* Remove rows with at least one null value
* Filtering to only keep rows where coins have been mined
* Remove columns that will not be used in clustering algorithm
* Use get_dummies() to create variables for the text features
* Use StandardScaler fit_transform() function to standardize the features

### Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions using PCA
* Apply PCA to reduce dimensions to three principal components
* Create a new DataFrame from the three principal compnenents to run the analysis

### Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
* Create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K
* Run the K-Means algorithm to make predictions of the K clusters for cryptocurrencies data
* Create a new DataFrame adding the coin data, principal components and class (predictions)

### Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
* Create 3D scatter plot using Plotly Express scatter_3d() function
* Create table with tradable cryptocurrencies using hvplot.table()
* Use MinMaxScaler().fit_transform() method to scale the coin supply and coins mined columns
* Create a new dataframe with coin supply, coins mined, and class (predictions)
* Create hvplot scatter plot to visualize coin supply and coins mined data
